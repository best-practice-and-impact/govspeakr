## {govspeakr} Demo

This is a minimal demonstration of {govspeakr} usage, based on the default R markdown template in Rstudio.

To try this demo:

1. knit this Rmarkdown file. This will produce HTML (.html) and Markdown (.md) outputs.
2. run `govspeakr::convert_md("PATH/minimal_govspeakr_demo.md")`, where PATH refers to the path to the Markdown file output.
This will generate `minimal_demo_converted.md`. Note that this file will contain the govspeak image reference notation !!1 to reference the first image in the `./images` directory.

To prevent generation of a HTML copy, use the following in the YAML header of this file:
`
output:
  md_document
`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Note that the output format of tables should be markdown
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r 1-pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Note that this chunk is named `n-description`, where n represents the position of this image chunk in the document
# This is required for image chunks (e.g. next image chunk would be 2-stuff)
# Multiple images are allowed in a single chunk - their order within the chunk is handled automatically
plot(pressure)
```
